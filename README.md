This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates a common yet subtle pointer-related error. The program intends to modify the value of an integer variable through a pointer, but there's a mistake in the way the pointer is handled.  The challenge is to identify and correct the error to achieve the intended behavior.  The solution file provides a corrected version of the code, highlighting the fix.
